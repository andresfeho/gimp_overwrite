# Gimp overwrite

Script to overwrite files in Gimp. I needed to create this because Massive doesn't like TIFF files created in Photoshop, so if you have tons of maps created in Photoshop, this is the tool

The asterisk asterisk/asterisk.TIF line is to iterate within all of the subfolders and all of the .TIF files.
